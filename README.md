# Data Stores 101
## What are Data Stores?
Data Stores are, unsurprisingly, used to store data. One Data Store can hold data for tens of thousands of different players, and can even be used to store non-player data! Storing data is essential for just about any game, so let's start with storing a single value.

For the sake of this tutorial, I've prepared a simple place where there are four things that we should be able to store by the endâ€”two different currencies, a color, and some items that the player can pick up. I won't go into detail on how to make this place, since that's not the focus of the article, but you can download it here.
