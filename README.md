# Data Stores 101
## What are Data Stores?
Data Stores are, unsurprisingly, used to store data. One Data Store can hold data for tens of thousands of different players, and can even be used to store non-player data! Storing data is essential for just about any game, so it's important to learn early on so you don't struggle with adding it when you're deep into a game's development.

For the sake of this tutorial, I've prepared a simple place where there are four things that we should be able to store by the endâ€”two different currencies, a color, and some items that the player can pick up. I won't go into detail on how to make this place, since that's not the focus of the article, but you can download it [here](https://mega.nz/file/lKhSFajA#CdQj8-1WcL0YSN2TpYBKogmuzon-mZCD6XEkbsrUHKI). If you download it, make sure to publish the place to Roblox and enable "Studio Access to API services" in the game settings.
## Storing a Single Value
Right now, I have a very simple script which creates some values for the player.
```lua
local Players = game:GetService("Players")

Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(function(player)
	
	local stats = Instance.new("Folder")
	stats.Name = "Stats"
	
	local coins = Instance.new("IntValue")
	coins.Name = "Coins"
	coins.Value = 100
	coins.Parent = stats
	
	local gems = Instance.new("IntValue")
	gems.Name = "Gems"
	gems.Value = 20
	gems.Parent = stats
	
	local color = Instance.new("Color3Value")
	color.Name = "Color"
	color.Value = Color3.fromRGB(255, 0, 0)
	color.Parent = stats
	
	stats.Parent = player
	
end)
```
Let's start off by just trying to save and load our Coins value.

First, we need to get the DataStoreService, and then get a Data Store using it.
```lua
local Players = game:GetService("Players")
local DataStoreService = game:GetService("DataStoreService")
local CoinsDataStore = DataStoreService:GetDataStore("Coins")
```
Using GetDataStore gives you the ability to read data from and write data to a unique Data Store. A game can have any number of Data Stores, but for most practical purposes, you aren't going to need more than one or two.

Now, we need to make it so that the Coins value saves when the player leaves. Let's add a PlayerRemoving connection, like this:
```lua
Players.PlayerRemoving:Connect(function(player)

	

end)
```
